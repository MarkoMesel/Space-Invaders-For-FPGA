<h1> Space Invaders for FPGA </h1>

<p>
  This is a diploma project made for the Faculty of Technical Sciences.
  It includes the code for a version of the video game “Space Invaders”, designed to run and be played on an FPGA-based computer.
  The goal of the project is to deliver a faithful adaptation of the game in both appearance and gameplay, while adhering to the limitations of the FPGA system.
